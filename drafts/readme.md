# NAP Reference Architecture – Working Drafts

This directory contains **working drafts** of the National Access Point Reference Architecture (NRA).  
Drafts represent ongoing development and are the primary place where updates, corrections, and improvements are made before they are included in an official release.

## 📂 Structure and Naming

Drafts follow the naming pattern:

```
<target-version>-draft.<iteration>
```

Examples:

```
1.1.0-draft.1 1.1.0-draft.2 2.0.0-draft.1
```

The folder:

```
/drafts/latest
```

always contains the **most up‑to‑date working draft**, including corrections to existing releases.

## 🧭 Purpose of This Directory

Drafts are used for:

- Preparing the next NRA release  
- Incorporating feedback from Member States and experts  
- Correcting issues identified in published releases  
- Testing new modelling approaches  
- Updating documentation and high‑level views  

Once a draft is validated and approved, it becomes a new numbered release.

## 🛠 Working With Draft Models

To open draft models in Enterprise Architect:

1. Create a **new, empty EA project**.  
2. Load the **FRAME toolbox**.  
3. Import the draft `.xmi` file.  

Importing the XMI before loading the toolbox will break stereotypes.

## 📌 Relationship to Releases

Stable, published versions of the NRA are available in:

```
/releases
```

Drafts should be considered **pre‑release material** and may change without notice.

When **ready for release**, clean the `drafts/latest` content since all will become a new tagged release and:

- commit, 
- tag (´vX.Y.Z´ to e.g. ´v2.1.1´) and 
- push. 

``` 
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```
