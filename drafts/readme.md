# NAP Reference Architecture Working Drafts

This draft is a living document and integrate revisions of the current release, and it is used as a basis for new releases.

When ready for release, clean the drafts/next content since all will become a new tagged release and commit, tag (vX.Y.Z to e.g. v2.1.1) and push. 

``` 
git add.
git commit -m "your commit message"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```
