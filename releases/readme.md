# NAP Reference Architecture – Official Releases

This directory contains the **official, stable releases** of the National Access Point Reference Architecture (NRA).  
Each release is immutable and reflects the consolidated understanding agreed within NAPCORE at the time of publication.

## 📦 Contents of Each Release

A typical release folder (e.g., `1.1.0/`) includes:

- **Architecture Model Files**
  - `*.qea` — Enterprise Architect project file
  - `*.xmi` — Model exchange file

- **Documentation**
  - Word-exported NRA documentation (`*.docx`)
  - Supporting descriptions and methodology material

## 🧭 Purpose of This Directory

Releases serve as:
- A **stable reference** for Member States and stakeholders  
- A **baseline for implementation** of harmonised NAPs  
- A **citation‑ready source** for policy and technical work  

Releases are **not modified** after publication.
