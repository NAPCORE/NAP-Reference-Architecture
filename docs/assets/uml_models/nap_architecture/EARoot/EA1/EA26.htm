It includes the Data Holder term as it is defined in MMTIS and RTTI regulations. For more information see the explanation in the Content Provider role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content Consumer (Data User)	&lt;/b&gt;any stakeholder that is specified by the delegated regulations explicitly as the user of the data/services made available by Content Providers via NAP. It includes the Data User term as it is specified in MMTIS and RTTI regulations. For more information see the explanation in the Content Consumer role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;EA GUID&lt;/b&gt;	Enterprise Architect unique identifier, uniquely identifying the object within the model&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;ITS Actor, Actor	&lt;/b&gt;part of an ITS value-added chain/network and is directly involved in value creation. It contributes to the added value of ITS benefits by using its ITS capabilities as part of its activities. It usually also represents the interests of ITS stakeholders who are not directly involved in the ITS value chain but have strong associated interests. The ITS end-user is also considered a special ITS actor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stakeholder	&lt;/b&gt;is an organization or individual interested in the deployment, operation, or outcomes of ITS services. They can be directly or indirectly affected by the decisions made during the entire lifecycle of ITS Services. They are usually decision-makers such as politicians, high-level managers, and others e.g., the general public or user groups; who typically have little or no knowledge of systems design and implementation beyond what they have acquired as end users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;ITS Vision	&lt;/b&gt;is the long-term objective and the aspirational goal for the future. The ITS Vision is shared by all ITS Stakeholders. It is a source of inspiration for the ITS Services and provides a clear goal to be adhered to by the ITS Services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;ITS Mission Statement	&lt;/b&gt;is a short statement that highlights what is needed to be done by the ITS Stakeholders in the present to achieve the ITS Vision. It summarizes the purpose of the existence of the ITS Services and guides their use by the ITS Actors and/or the end users. It formulates a clearly structured, overarching policy objective of the defined ITS service deployment, considering the interests of stakeholders and end-users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Business Expectations	&lt;/b&gt;are what the ITS Stakeholders aim to achieve by the implementation/operation of the ITS Service. Business Expectations could be the political, economic, social, socio-economic, socio-political, operational, organisational, safety, and efficiency-related added values that are associated with an ITS service and are formulated as goals. These expectations are used together with the ITS Mission Statement to define the ITS Service&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;ITS Service	&lt;/b&gt;is a formal description of an ITS service. It describes a value-added service provided by ITS actors to the end-users. The added value is created by combining technologies, organizations, processes, and people. The service can be delivered by a single actor or in cooperation with others, and it creates added value that may consist of individual benefits for end users, collective benefits for end-user groups or society, or a mixture of both. It describes the idea and functional elements of the ITS service as well as framework conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;ITS Domain	&lt;/b&gt;is a concept that categorizes the diverse applications of ITS into specific fields of application. It applies sector-specific knowledge and additional architectural knowledge to ITS. The domain also defines the boundaries of the ITS system or service at the start of an ITS architecture project, distinguishing it from similar or adjacent systems or services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;ITS Service Added Value	&lt;/b&gt;represents monetary and nonmonetary benefits that are gained by the implementation of the ITS Service. Each individual ITS Service Added Value outlines a particular, impact/benefit of implementing the ITS Service affecting one or more stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Specification: &lt;/b&gt;detailed, precise description of the requirements, design, behaviour, or characteristics of a system, component, or process. Specifications are used to ensure that everyone involved in a project understands what is expected and to provide a basis for verifying that the final product meets the required standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</div>
