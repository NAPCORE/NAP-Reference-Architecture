	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">Member State authorities shall appoint a NB/CA and make sure that this NB/CA is properly authorised, &lt;br/&gt;according to national regulations, to receive and process self-declarations.&lt;br/&gt;The NB/CA will need the following preparation before being ready to receive self-declarations:&lt;br/&gt;&#183; Identify and organise resources for receiving and processing self-declarations and for &lt;br/&gt;performing compliance assessment and random inspections.&lt;br/&gt;&#183; Develop an internal process for receiving and processing self-declarations, taking into account &lt;br/&gt;both European regulation and contextual factors present in the Member State such as the&lt;br/&gt;number of service or data providers expected to submit a self-declaration and national &lt;br/&gt;administrative law.&lt;br/&gt;&#183; Develop a plan on how to identify data and service providers covered by the delegated &lt;br/&gt;regulation and how the NB/CA will approach the stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&#183; Provide national templates for self-declarations and accompanying documents.&lt;br/&gt;&#183; Compile Member State specific instructions for data and service providers on how to fill in and &lt;br/&gt;submit a self-declaration and related accompanying documents.&lt;br/&gt;After the NB/CA has been nominated and necessary preparations have been carried out, it will provide &lt;br/&gt;information to potential data and service providers on their obligation to submit a self-declaration and &lt;br/&gt;provide instructions on how to fill in and submit a self-declaration. The NB/CA may inform the &lt;br/&gt;stakeholders with different methods such as email campaigns, sending letters, publishing information &lt;br/&gt;on the NAP website or arranging workshops. &lt;br/&gt;To identify the relevant actors obligated to submit a self-declaration, the NB/CA may use procedures &lt;br/&gt;specific to its Member State. These may include e.g., utilisation of the contacts of the NAP operator. &lt;br/&gt;Good knowledge of the national mobility landscape is required to identify the stakeholders potentially &lt;br/&gt;having an obligation to submit a self-declaration. To increase its knowledge and to build a more &lt;br/&gt;complete picture of the mobility landscape, the NB/CA may collaborate with local or regional transport &lt;br/&gt;authorities. When exchanging information between authorities, GDPR compliance is necessary.&lt;br/&gt;After being contacted by the NB/CA, the data or service provider submits a data set or service to the &lt;br/&gt;National Access Point (NAP), international access point or content access point as required by the &lt;br/&gt;applicable delegated regulation. After submitting the service or data set, the provider fills in and &lt;br/&gt;submits the self-declaration form to the NB/CA. This can take place either electronically (i.e., by email &lt;br/&gt;or by indicating compliance via a checkbox) or in paper form. &lt;br/&gt;The processing of a self-declaration form starts with verification of the contact details of the data or &lt;br/&gt;service provider and checking whether the NB/CA is responsible and acknowledged for the respective &lt;br/&gt;delegated regulation. In case of incomplete or inconsistent contact details, the NB/CA may request the &lt;br/&gt;data or service provider to update its contact details. If the stakeholder does not provide the missing contact details or does not correct erroneous contact details, the NB/CA may stop processing the selfdeclaration. After verification of contact details, the NB/CA verifies the completeness of the selfdeclaration. In practice, this means checking that all mandatory fields of the self-declaration form have &lt;br/&gt;been filled in, and all required accompanying documents have been provided. If needed, the NB/CA&lt;br/&gt;may request the data or service provider to update the self-declaration and complete the missing &lt;br/&gt;parts. After a complete self-declaration has been received, the NB/CA can provide an &lt;br/&gt;acknowledgement to the data or service provider. After receiving and processing the self-declaration, &lt;br/&gt;the NB/CA might update the results to a registry/database (which is not compulsory) of processed selfdeclarations. At the same time, the NB/CA may also update the registry of compliant services and data &lt;br/&gt;sets (optional), if it has been established in the Member State. Contents of these registries will be the &lt;br/&gt;basis for periodic reporting related to the ITS Directive and delegated regulations in the Member State &lt;br/&gt;and at the European level. The random inspections that are carried out periodically at pre-determined &lt;br/&gt;intervals also check the collected self-declarations and descriptions of compliant services and data sets. In the following figures, digital map producers and broadcasters are included in &#8220;data or &lt;br/&gt;service provider&#8221;&lt;br/&gt;</div>
