NAP (National Access Point) Reference Architecture is built using [the FRAME Reference Architecture](frame.md).

## Based on FRAME Repository and FRAME Meta Model

The NAP Reference Architecture is using components from:

- [FRAME Repository](uml/frame_repository.md) and
- [FRAME Meta Model](uml/frame_metamodel.md).

## Extending standard model where needed

During NAP Reference Architecture development, there were cases when standard FRAME Repository and/or Meta Model did not suffice. In such cases, the standard model was modified.

These modification will eventually be incorporated back into standard FRAME Repository and/or Meta Model in future.

To learn more about these model deviations, see changelogs at browsable model descriptions.

## [Browsable HTML UML Model](uml/nap_architecture.md)

The [browsable NAP Reference Architecture HTML UML Model](uml/nap_architecture.md) includes changelog too.
