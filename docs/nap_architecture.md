NAP (National Access Point) Reference Architecture is built using [FRAME](frame.md).

!!! note "Scope & objectives"
	
	The NAP reference architecture describes the minimum required functionalities, processes, and interfaces to enable a harmonized exchange of information (metadata and data) for an EU-wide reuse of data to create the basis for an EU-wide mobility data space.

The NRA describes the minimum functionality for the two basic NAP types the Metadata directory and Data Platform in the following detail:

- __Motivational layer__: This answers the question of WHY and sets up the system.
- __Functional view__: This describes the bounded functionalities of the system, with information exchange (among functionalities, and with other systems). It also describes pro-cesses realized by the functionalities.
- __Physical view__: This describes how the functionality could be implemented in separate sub-systems and identifies the critical interfaces that need to be harmonized.
- __Communications view__: This describes the interaction and data exchange between the different components of the system.
- __Organizational (enterprise) view__: This describes the relationships between actors in the system.

## Based on FRAME Repository and FRAME Meta Model

The NAP Reference Architecture is using components from [FRAME Repository](uml/frame_repository.md) and [FRAME Meta Model](uml/frame_metamodel.md).

## Extending standard model where needed

During NAP Reference Architecture development, there were cases when standard FRAME Repository and/or Meta Model did not suffice. In such cases, the standard model was modified.

These modification will eventually be incorporated back into standard FRAME Repository and/or Meta Model in future.
