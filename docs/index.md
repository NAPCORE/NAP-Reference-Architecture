This site presents [National Access Point (NAP) Reference Architecture](uml/nap_architecture.md), based on the [European ITS Framework Architecture (FRAME) methodology](frame.md).

NRA aims to harmonize NAP activities at the European level and increase their effectiveness. It defines roles, functions, and processes for NAP users and data registration and data/metadata retrieval. It also outlines the minimum functionality for the two basic NAP types at the national level (Metadata directory and Data Platform).

Main content of this site is a browsable UML model of the NAP Reference Architecture. To complement the NRA model we also include FRAME models for the reference.

## Acknowledgment

The NAP Reference Architecture (NRA) was developed within the project [FRAME-NEXT](https://frame-next.eu/) and was further upgraded according to the NAP operator needs within the project [NAPCORE](https://napcore.eu/). Both Programme support actions (PSA) co-financed by EU from Connection European Facility (CEF) programme.
