# NAPCORE Reference Architectures

This site presents National Access Point (NAP) and National Body Reference Architectures based on the European ITS Framework Architecture (FRAME) methodology.

Reference architecture  aims to harmonize  activities at the European level and increase their effectiveness. It defines roles, functions, and processes, physical interactions, interfaces and system requirements.

Main content of this site are browsable UML models of the NAP and NB Reference Architectures. To complement the NRA model we also include FRAME models for the reference.
