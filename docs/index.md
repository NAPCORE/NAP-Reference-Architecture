This site presents [National Access Point (NAP) Reference Architecture](uml/nap_architecture.md), based on the [European ITS Framework Architecture (FRAME) methodology](frame.md).

NRA aims to harmonize NAP activities at the European level and increase their effectiveness. It defines roles, functions, and processes for NAP users and data registration and data/metadata re-trieval. It also outlines the minimum functionality for the two basic NAP types at the national level (Metadata directory and Data Platform).

!!! note "Scope & objectives"
	
	The NAP reference architecture describes the minimum required functionalities, processes, and interfaces to enable a harmonized exchange of information (metadata and data) for an EU-wide reuse of data to create the basis for an EU-wide mobility data space.

Main content of this site is a browseable UML model of the NAP Reference Architecture. To complement the NRA model we also include FRAME models for the reference.

## Ackgnowledgemnt

The NAP Reference Architecture (NRA) was developed within the project [FRAME-NEXT](https://frame-next.eu/) and was further upgraded according to the NAP operator needs within the project [NAPCORE](https://napcore.eu/). Both Programme supprt actions (PSA) cofinanced by EU from Connection European Facility (CEF) programme.
