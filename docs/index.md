This site presents [National Access Point (NAP) Reference Architecture](uml/nap_architecture.md), based on the [European ITS Framework Architecture (FRAME) methodology](frame.md).

NRA aims to harmonize NAP activities at the European level and increase their effectiveness. It defines roles, functions, and processes for NAP users and data registration and data/metadata re-trieval. It also outlines the minimum functionality for the two basic NAP types at the national level (Metadata directory and Data Platform).

The design principles of the NRA are simplicity, transferability, and understandability. Utilizing the NRA should yield benefits such as:

- Compatibility at the European level with minimum components and detailed system func-tionality
- Identification of gaps and harmonization and emerging needs in system specification
- Easier inclusion of new systems or components through the technical system description
- Improved usability based on gathered experience and evolving user needs
- Enhanced planning of implementation phases, goal documentation, and result comparison

!!! note "Scope & objectives"
	
	The NAP reference architecture describes the minimum required functionalities, processes, and interfaces to enable a harmonized exchange of information (metadata and data) for an EU-wide reuse of data to create the basis for an EU-wide mobility data space.

Main content of this site is a browseable UML model of the NAP Reference Architecture. To complement the NRA model we also include FRAME models for the reference.

## Ackgnowledgemnt

The NAP Reference Architecture (NRA) was developed within the project [FRAME-NEXT](https://frame-next.eu/) and was further upgraded according to the NAP operator needs within the project [NAPCORE](https://napcore.eu/). Both Programme supprt actions (PSA) cofinanced by EU from Connection European Facility (CEF) programme.
