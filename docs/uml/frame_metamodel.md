FRAME meta model defines objects used by updated FRAME. The meta-model has a different structuring than the final views of the architecture, it structures the FRAME artefacts into five sections. The first four sections develop from a high-level perspective down to more technical details of the service. The last layer contains artefacts, which are relevant for all sections. 

The sections are __Motivational Layer__, __Business Layer__, __Application Layer__, __Data Layer__ and __External__
