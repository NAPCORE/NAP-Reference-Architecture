This Regulation establishes the necessary specifications in order to ensure that EU-wide multimodal travel information services are accurate and available across borders to ITS users.&lt;br/&gt;2. This Regulation applies to the entire transport network of the Union.&lt;br/&gt;3. This Regulation shall apply in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/40/EU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessibility, exchange and reuse of static travel and traffic data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Transport authorities, transport operators, infrastructure managers or transport on demand service providers shall provide the static travel and traffic data and historic traffic data listed in point 1 of the Annex, of the different transport modes by using:&lt;br/&gt;(a) for the road transport, the standards defined in Article 4 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/962;&lt;br/&gt;(b) for other transport modes, the use of one of the following standards and technical specifications: NeTEx CEN/TS 16614 and subsequent versions, technical documents defined in Regulation (EU) No 454/2011 and subsequent versions, technical documents elaborated by IATA or any machine-readable format fully compatible and interoperable with those standards and technical specifications;&lt;br/&gt;(c) for the spatial network the requirements defined in Article 7 of Directive 2007/2/EC.&lt;br/&gt;2. The relevant static travel and traffic data listed in point 1 of the Annex that are applicable to NeTEx and DATEX II&lt;br/&gt;shall be represented through minimum national profiles.&lt;br/&gt;3. Transport authorities, transport operators, infrastructure managers or transport on demand service providers shall provide the static travel and traffic data through the national access point in the required formats in line with the following timetable:&lt;br/&gt;(a) for the travel and traffic data set out in point 1.1 of the Annex for the comprehensive TEN-T network, by 1 December 2019 at the latest;&lt;br/&gt;(b) for the travel and traffic data set out in point 1.2 of the Annex for the comprehensive TEN-T network, by 1 December 2020 at the latest;&lt;br/&gt;(c) for the travel and traffic data set out in point 1.3 of the Annex for the comprehensive TEN-T network, by 1 December 2021 the latest;&lt;br/&gt;(d) for the travel and traffic data set out in points 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 of the Annex for the other parts of the Union transport network, by 1 December 2023 at the latest.&lt;br/&gt;4. APIs that provide access to static travel and traffic data listed in the Annex via the national access point shall be publicly accessible allowing users and end-users to register to obtain access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessibility, exchange and reuse of dynamic travel and traffic data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Where the Member States decide to provide the dynamic travel and traffic data of different transport modes listed in point 2 of the Annex through the national access point, transport authorities, transport operators, infrastructure managers or transport on demand service providers shall use:&lt;br/&gt;(a) for the road transport the standards defined in Articles 5 and 6 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/962;&lt;br/&gt;(b) for the other transport modes: SIRI CEN/TS 15531 and subsequent versions, technical documents defined in Regulation (EU) No 454/2011 or any machine-readable format fully compatible and interoperable with those standards or technical documents.&lt;br/&gt;2. The relevant travel and traffic data referred to in point 2 of the Annex applicable to SIRI and DATEX II shall be represented through minimum national profiles determined by Member States accessible through the national access point.&lt;br/&gt;3. APIs that provide access to dynamic travel and traffic data listed in the Annex via the national access point shall be publicly accessible allowing users and end-users to register to obtain access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data updates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Travel information services shall be based on updates of static and dynamic travel and traffic data.&lt;br/&gt;2. When changes occur, the relevant static and dynamic travel and traffic data listed in the Annex shall be updated by transport authorities, transport operators, infrastructure managers or transport on demand service providers through the national access point in a timely manner. They shall in a timely manner correct any inaccuracies detected by them in their data or signalled to them by any user or end user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linking travel information services&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Upon request, travel information service providers shall provide to another information service provider routing results based on static, and where possible, dynamic information.&lt;br/&gt;2. Routing results shall be based on:&lt;br/&gt;(a) the enquirers start and end points of a journey along with the specific time and date of departure or arrival, or both;&lt;br/&gt;(b) possible travel options along with the specific time and date of departure or arrival, or both, including any possible connections;&lt;br/&gt;(c) the handover point between travel information services;&lt;br/&gt;(d) in case of disturbances, alternative possible travel options along with the specific time and date of departure or arrival, or both, and any connections, where available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Requirements for service provisions reuse of travel and traffic data and linking of travel information services&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The travel and traffic data listed in the Annex and the corresponding metadata including information on the quality thereof shall be accessible for exchange and reuse within the Union on a non-discriminatory basis, through the national or common access point and within a time-frame that ensures the timely provision of travel information services. They shall be accurate and up to date.&lt;br/&gt;2. The data referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reused in a neutral manner and without discrimination or bias. Criteria used for ranking travel options of different transport modes or combinations thereof, or both, shall be transparent and not be based on any factor directly or indirectly relating to the user identity or, if any, the commercial consideration related to the reuse of the data and shall be applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all participating users. The first principle travel itinerary presentation shall not mislead the end-user.&lt;br/&gt;3. Where reusing the static and dynamic travel or traffic data, the source of those data shall be indicated. The date and time of the last update of the static data shall also be indicated.&lt;br/&gt;4. The terms and conditions for the use of the traffic and travel data provided through the national access point may be determined through a licence agreement. Those conditions shall not unnecessarily restrict possibilities for reuse or be used to restrict competition. Licence agreements, whenever used, shall in any event impose as few restrictions on reuse as possible. Any financial compensation shall be reasonable and proportionate to the legitimate costs incurred of providing and disseminating the relevant travel and traffic data.&lt;br/&gt;5. Terms and conditions of linking travel information services shall be defined in contractual agreements between the travel information service providers.
