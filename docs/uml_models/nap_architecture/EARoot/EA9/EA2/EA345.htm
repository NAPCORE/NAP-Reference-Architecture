	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">The features included in the data exchange and operational policy subset, firstly, aim to ensure that NAPs provide &lt;b&gt;clear descriptions of the terms and conditions&lt;/b&gt; for data re-use and of their &lt;b&gt;operational procedures&lt;/b&gt;. Terms and conditions for data re-use set out the ways in which data hosted in/accommodated through NAPs can and cannot be re-used. The clarification of the terms and conditions for data re-use, despite not being directly the responsibility of NAP operators, is deemed important because by that means disputes between data providers and consumers can be avoided and the estimation of the impact of data hosted in/provided through NAPs can be facilitated (e.g., through attribution obligations). In this respect, NAPs should make the best effort to facilitate the clarification of these terms and conditions by providing, for instance, data providers with prespecified licenses to be selected during the publication of a new dataset. On the other hand, the clarification of the operational procedures of a NAP eases the understanding of the role and responsibilities of all actors involved in the NAP ecosystem (i.e., NAP operator, data providers, data consumers). This can be supported, for instance, by the inclusion in the NAP of a brief set of instructions, providing guidelines and explanations on: a) the user types and their access rights, b) how a user can be registered and authenticated, c) how datasets can be published, and d) how often should datasets be updated.&lt;br/&gt;The features included in the data exchange and operational policy subset, secondly, aim to ensure that NAPs endorse the provision of high-quality data that simultaneously comply with the requirements set by the Delegated Acts of the ITS Directive. In this respect, it would be beneficial if NAPs enable data providers to &lt;b&gt;indicate the quality of provided data&lt;/b&gt; or ideally &lt;b&gt;set quality requirements&lt;/b&gt;. However, the latter feature should not be mandatory given that it most closely resembles digital clearing houses and data marketplaces. Moreover, it would be beneficial if NAPs &lt;b&gt;promote and monitor the provision of self-declarations&lt;/b&gt; on behalf of data providers, thus facilitating the activities of Nominated Bodies relating to the declaration of compliance of datasets published in the NAPs.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, a desirable property of the NAPs revolves around the consolidated &lt;b&gt;coverage of data types included in all Delegated Regulations&lt;/b&gt; supplementing the ITS Directive. Through this property NAPs are understood as a single point of access to data resources required to support the uptake of Intelligent Transport System services as well as of newer concepts, such as Mobility as a Service and Urban Vehicle Access Regulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</div>
