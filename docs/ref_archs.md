# Reference Architecture Introduction

!!! abstract "Scope & objectives"
	
	The reference architecture describes the minimum required functionalities, processes, and interfaces to enable a harmonized exchange of information (metadata and data) for an EU-wide reuse of data to create the basis for an EU-wide mobility data space.

	The Reference architecture describes the minimum functionality for the National Access Point and for the National Body in the following detail:

	- __Motivational layer__: This answers the question of WHY and sets up the system.
	- __Functional view__: This describes the bounded functionalities of the system, with information exchange (among functionalities, and with other systems). It also describes pro-cesses realized by the functionalities.
	- __Physical view__: This describes how the functionality could be implemented in separate sub-systems and identifies the critical interfaces that need to be harmonized.
	- __Communications view__: This describes the interaction and data exchange between the different components of the system.
	- __Organizational (enterprise) view__: This describes the relationships between actors in the system.

??? quote "Based on the FRAME Methodology"

	The NAP and NB Reference Architectures are using [FRAME](frame.md) methodology.

	During NAP and NB Reference Architecture development, there were cases when standard FRAME Repository and/or Meta Model did not suffice. In such cases, the standard model was modified.

	These modification will eventually be incorporated back into standard FRAME Repository and/or Meta Model in future.
